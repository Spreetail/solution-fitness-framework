## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration saves development teams time when building software. It increases the chances of successful changes to solutions in production by removing manual, error prone steps in a build process for a software system. Continuous integration also works to remove tribal knowledge surrounding the delivery of services to the company.

Once continuous integration is added to a system, other parts of a modern, healthy software system are more easily added. It acts as a catalyst that leads to easier unit tests, more frequent releases, and more developer able to work in the same codebase. 

*Acceptance Criteria* - Existence of configured CI pipeline that automatically builds projects in a codebase, triggered by new changes being merged into the master branch of a codebase.
