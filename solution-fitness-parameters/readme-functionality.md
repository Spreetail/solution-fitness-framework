## Readme - Functionality
Each solution needs summary documentation about what the system does and why it is important. The purpose of this documentation is to accurately describe the intended functionality of a system in a self-service model. 

This type of documentation seems like it would always be present in a codebase, and that is true for most applications. This parameter is most effective when covering the "long-tail" of applications in an enterprise platform - applications that serve a singular purpose and are rarely changed, like "one-off" windows services and scheduled tasks.

The self-service aspect of the parameter is important. Developers should be able to discern the functionality and purpose of a system through this brief documentation. Developers should not have to ask other developers basic questions on what functions an application performs. The documentation associated with this parameter is important when on-boarding developers to teams. 

*Acceptance Criteria* - Presence of the section in the codebase Readme file.
