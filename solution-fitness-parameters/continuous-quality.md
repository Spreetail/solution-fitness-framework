## Continuous Quality

Continuous Quality (CQ) is an extension of the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment process. The CQ step calculates an objective measure of software quality. This parameter is important to ensure that changes improve software systems (not make them worse).

This parameter does not apply to all systems, but gives development team insights into quality of systems through static analysis tools. 

*Acceptance Criteria* - Objective quality measurement through SonarQube as a step in the CI/CD process.
