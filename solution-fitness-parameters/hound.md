## Hound

Hound is a high-performance cross-codebase search tool. Codebases should be integrated with the Hound search tool to increase developer velocity. Hound allows developers to rapidly identify relevant code and investigate common characteristics between solutions. Codebases excluded from Hound are largely subject to tribal knowledge outside of the owner.

This search tool is powerful when working with larger systems, or groups of systems. It greatly increases the confidence of high-risk activities, like database refactoring.
