## Readme - Future Roadmap
Each solution needs a roadmap. Software teams need to discuss and document the intended future of their applications. 

This style of documentation is important for several reasons. It serves as a contract artifact between development teams and their business counterparts/stakeholder teams. This documentation can surface vital discussions if software teams and business teams have conflicting views on the development roadmap. The roadmap is also important for other developers to understand the life-cycle of applications. If roadmaps are not clearly communicated, services can eventually get built on top of other services that might soon be deprecated. This will cause new services to absorb existing functionality or extend the life of a service past its original limit.
