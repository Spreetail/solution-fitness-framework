## Readme - Local Development
Each solution needs instructions on how to run it on a developer machine. This increases the "bus-factor" with systems (and associated teams) by capturing the operational knowledge of a system in concise readme instructions. 

This documentation is typically needed in "long-tail" applications. It is difficult to justify the benefit of writing this style of documentation, until there is employee turnover. This documentation is vital in situations where there is employee turnover.

The effort required in documenting local development should be low effort. If local development instructions are long and cumbersome, it is a direct indicator that the application deserves some refactoring and tooling work to allow for more developers to contribute more easily.
