## Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment saves development teams time when deploying changes to software. It also greatly decreases the chance of errors in the software deployment process. This parameter is important because it removes tribal knowledge surrounding the deployment and hosting configuration of services deployed in an enterprise. 

Continuous Deployment works closely with Continuous Integration to provide a pleasant avenue for software delivery.
