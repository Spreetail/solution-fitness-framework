## Source Control

Solutions need to be group logically in the source control management system to make developer access to the appropriate systems easy and "logical". This parameter also covers application naming, and can be used to enforce a common naming scheme across all projects. 

This parameter may seem tedious, but it is important to consider when working with a large number of systems spread across a large enterprise.

*Acceptance Criteria* - Department members agree that group is logical and system naming conventions are being met.
