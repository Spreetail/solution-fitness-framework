## APM Integration 

AKA "New Relic"

Application Performance Management (or Monitoring) (APM) gives development teams an objective view of how well systems are performing in production. APM tools go beyond machine monitoring and provide application specific results on poor performing or over-worked areas of an application. This is important because the of the objective measures that can be observed through APM.

APM tools advance rapidly, and provide additional functionality to alert developers to software issues and data aggregation capabilities that can be used to improve not just software, but the business for which the software is working.
