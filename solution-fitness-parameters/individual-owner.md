## Individual Owner
The Individual Owner of a codebase is the singular point of contact for all information related to a system. An individual owner increases the ownership of an application. Spreetail believes that individuals can take more responsibility for the success of an application or process if they have more control. This is preferred over having a group of owners - the group of owners can create situations of missed responsibilities because one party assumed the other party had control over the situation. 

Individual Owners are typically team leads, but others can be assigned to the Individual Owner role. Teams that manage a wide variety of codebases often use developers as Individual Owners of systems. This is also a common way to identify where teams are growing too large and need to split.
