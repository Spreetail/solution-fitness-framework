## Tests

Applications need automated tests for a variety of reasons. Testing increases the confidence in development of new features. They also work to ensure that existing functionality is insulated against new changes. Tests explore the limits of a software systems's functionality, as well as serving as great documentation for the existing behavior of a software system. 

The acceptance criteria for Tests is laughably low - it is satisfied if one unit test is present in a codebase. The bar is set so low so more developers show interest in automated testing. 

*Acceptance Criteria* - At least one automated test project that contains at least one automated test for a codebase.
